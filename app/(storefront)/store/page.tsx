/**
 * ShoppingPage.tsx (Server Component) — updated for Phase 1
 *
 * Key change: `initialSearchParams` is no longer passed to `<ShoppingList>`.
 * The client component reads all params directly from `useSearchParams()`, so
 * passing them down as props was redundant and created a double-source-of-truth
 * bug where stale prop values overrode fresh URL state on navigation.
 *
 * The server component retains its SEO responsibilities (generateMetadata) and
 * can pre-fetch category data for the title — it just no longer needs to
 * hydrate the client with param values.
